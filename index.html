		<h2 id="bio">About me</h2></div>
		I am an undergraduate student at The University of Texas at Austin, pursuing a Bachelor of Science in Informatics with a focus on Human-Centered Data Science. I am studying a Minor in Programming and Computation and a Minor in Risk Management. My studies include coursework in Cybersecurity, Machine Learning, Database Design, Data Analytics and Visualization, and Risk Management. I am also a student fellow at the Texas Cybersecurity Clinic, where I contribute to cybersecurity resilience efforts with Devine, TX.

        <h3 id="ML">Technical Experience</h3>
        </div>
        <p>I am an Undergraduate Associate Researcher in the AI/ML/NLP Labs under the supervision of Dr. Mishra since April 2024. My primary programming language is Python, which I utilize extensively for developing machine learning models, data analysis pipelines, and natural language processing tasks. I have hands-on experience with various machine learning frameworks and libraries such as TensorFlow, PyTorch, and Scikit-learn, as well as data manipulation tools like Pandas and NumPy. My work spans across deep learning, computer vision, and NLP, including projects like training and fine-tuning Vision-Language Models (VLMs), creating OCR datasets, and building efficient task-oriented pipelines. Additionally, I am skilled in data visualization using Matplotlib, database management with SQL, and deploying user-friendly interfaces with tools like Gradio and Tkinter.</p>

        <h3 id="cyber">Cybersecurity</h3>
        </div>
        <p>As a Student Fellow at the Texas Cybersecurity Clinic, I contribute to enhancing cybersecurity resilience by conducting pre-incident risk assessments, performing vulnerability scans, and implementing security policies to protect critical infrastructure. Building on this experience, I am also a member of the Hash Trio team, competing in the Cyber 9/12 Strategy Challenge 2025 in Austin, Texas. This prestigious competition, hosted by the Atlantic Council, challenges teams to analyze and respond to simulated cyber crises, fostering innovative policy recommendations and strategic thinking. These opportunities have deepened my expertise in cybersecurity while honing my collaborative and problem-solving skills.</p>

        <h2 id="research">My research</h2></div>
        <p>My primary research focuses on applied machine learning and natural language processing (NLP) in practical applications. During my work at the AI/ML/NLP Lab under Dr. Mishra, I helped build on-device Tiny Vision Language Models (Tiny VLMs) for task-oriented instruction processing and enhanced privacy, security, and efficiency by eliminating the need to transmit sensitive visual data to servers. </p>

For the project "Phish in the Web" in the Applied Machine Learning in Python course, we developed a machine learning-based phishing website detection system. Leveraging a dataset of 10,000 URLs, we extracted key features such as URL length, subdomain level, and the presence of special characters to distinguish phishing websites from legitimate ones. We implemented several classification models, including Random Forest, SVM, MLP, and Logistic Regression, and achieved a highest AUC score of 0.982 using the Random Forest model. To enhance usability, we designed an interactive demo using Gradio, allowing users to input a URL and receive real-time predictions on its safety. This project provided hands-on experience in feature engineering, data preprocessing, model optimization, and creating user-friendly interfaces, addressing a critical challenge in cybersecurity.

The dataset, consisting of 7,043 data points and 33 features, included demographics, service usage, and payment details. We started with data cleaning and feature selection to remove irrelevant variables, followed by statistical testing to uncover key factors contributing to churn. Insights revealed that churn was primarily driven by issues such as poor customer support and competitive offers with higher download speeds. To enhance prediction accuracy, we developed three machine learning models using Random Forest classification. Our second model, which balanced the dataset through undersampling, achieved the best overall performance with precision, recall, and F1 scores of approximately 0.76. The most influential features in predicting churn included customer tenure, total charges, and monthly charges. Based on these findings, we proposed a comprehensive solution involving preemptive targeting of high-risk customers, improved customer support, and competitive incentives to reduce churn effectively.

This system addresses critical needs, including managing books, tracking reservations, borrowing processes, and study room availability. We began with defining the system's requirements, designing entity-relationship diagrams (ERDs), and normalizing the database to ensure data integrity and eliminate redundancy. Key features include real-time tracking of book availability, streamlined room reservations, and a comprehensive interface for administrators to manage resources effectively. We implemented the system by creating tables, inserting data, and running complex queries to answer critical questions such as identifying overdue books, tracking reservation statistics, and analyzing resource utilization. This project not only demonstrated the importance of functional dependencies and normalization but also provided valuable hands-on experience in database design, query optimization, and creating user-centric solutions for real-world scenarios.
